I am a Pre-Doctoral Research Assistant at the International Inequalities Institute at the London School of Economics, working with Arun Advani and Andy Summers.

I graduated summa cum laude with a master's in Economics from the Paris School of Economics in September 2023. Prior to that, I graduated summa cum laude in July 2021 with a bachelorâ€™s in Economics from the University of Bologna, where I was a fellow at Collegio Superiore.

My research interests lie primarily in the field of labor and public economics.
