          <p>I am a master&rsquo;s student in Public Policy and Development at <a href="https://parisschoolofeconomics.eu">Paris School of Economics</a>.
I graduated summa cum laude in July 2021 with a bachelor&rsquo;s in Economics, Markets and Institutions at the <a href="https://unibo.it">University of Bologna</a>, where I was a fellow at <a href="https://www.collegio.unibo.it">Collegio Superiore</a>.</p>
<p>My research interests lie primarily in the field of labor economics, in general as well as in particular from a gender perspective. This is a field I have been interested in since taking a course in Labor Economics during my bachelor&rsquo;s as additional coursework beyond the requirements for my degree. The interest for this field led me to choose to work on the gender division of labor in households for my Bachelor&rsquo;s final project (see <a href="/projects">projects</a> section).
Currently, I am also working with other students from different Italian honors colleges (Collegio Superiore, <a href="https://www.sns.it">Scuola Normale Superiore</a>, <a href="http://unipd-scuolagalileiana.it/">Scuola Galileiana di Studi Superiori</a>) on a paper concerning an empirical analysis of the factors that influence admission to such schools.</p>
<p>I have previous experience in research, having worked as a research intern and collaborated on a paper which is currently under review. In addition, I have extensive experience in technical and scientific writing thanks to the coursework required for my bachelor&rsquo;s fellowship.</p>
<p>During my bachelor&rsquo;s, I was the TA for the seminar in <a href="http://www.collegio.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamento/2020/464807">Equity and Efficiency in Taxation Policies</a> at Collegio Superiore.
Furthermore, I have been on exchange at <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/">Tilburg University</a>, with a study track focused on econometrics and public administration.</p>
<p>I am proficient in advanced use of the R programming language for applications in econometrics and have used the RMarkdown framework in projects in labor economics and analyses of inequality, as well as for a comprehensive replication study during my exchange.</p>
